### Employment & Experience

#### Aug 2024 - Present
**Postdoctoral Researcher, Center for Turbulence Research, Mechanical Engineering Department, Stanford University, California**

- Collaborating with groups from Stanford, Princeton, and Melbourne on the SAPPHiRe project.
- Modelling the effect of large-scale motions on subconvective pressure and wall shear stress.
- Developing a mathematical framework and scaling arguments to predict the footprint of very large-scale motions important on wall metrics.
- Using SOTA experimental measurements and data-assimilation techniques to inform the resolvent analysis.
- Supervisor: Beverley McKeon

#### Jan 2023 - Jan 2024
**Visiting Researcher, Marine Transport Technology Group, TU Delft, The Netherlands**

- Developed novel resolvent analysis methodology to assess the hydrodynamic stability of swimming foils, tackling challenges that come with analysing solutions with moving bodies.
- Forged academic partnerships, laying the groundwork for research collaborations.
- Adapted to and optimised workflows in a novel High-Performance Computing (HPC) setting.

### Projects & Publications

#### Massey, J., Ganapathisubramani, B., & Weymouth, G. (2023). A systematic investigation into the effect of roughness on self-propelled swimming plates. *Journal of Fluid Mechanics*, 971, A39. [doi:10.1017/jfm.2023.703](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2023.703)
- Examined the impact of egg-carton surface roughness on the hydrodynamics of Self-Propelled Swimming (SPS) bodies.
- Identified that decreasing roughness wavelength necessitates higher undulation speeds to counteract drag, leading to higher energy costs and reduced swimming efficiency.
- Revealed that roughness can significantly enhance flow enstrophy without corresponding force spikes, indicating induced secondary flow structures extending to the boundary layer edge.

- Investigates and develops the Data-Driven resolvent analysis framework.
- Applied a novel coordinate transform to study the boundary-layer of moving bodies.
