## About Me

I am a researcher specialising in fluid dynamics, leveraging a strong background in high-performance computing to employ advanced simulations and data analytics. My work aims to deepen our understanding of complex fluid systems, contributing to the broader field of applied mathematics and engineering.

## Academic Background

- **PhD in Fluid Dynamics**
  - **Institution:** University of Southampton
  - **Research Focus:** Investigated the effect of roughness on the hydrodynamics of aquatic locomotion, particularly exploring whether fish scales improve swimming efficiency.
  - **Key Findings:** Provided new insights into the role of surface texture in reducing drag and enhancing propulsion in aquatic environments.
  - **Thesis Link:** [My PhD Thesis](files/thesis.pdf)

## Current Research

- **Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford University**
  - **Research Group:** [Name of the Research Group or Lab]
  - **Project Focus:** Examining and modelling the impact of large-scale fluctuations on sub-convective pressure and wall shear stress.
  - **Objectives:**
    - Analyse linear and nonlinear contributions to sub-convective pressure fluctuations.
    - Investigate the origin of sub-convective shear stress fluctuations, particularly wall-normal velocity gradients at the wall.
    - Understand the spatial origins and underlying nonlinear interactions that excite these fluctuations.
  - **Methodology:** Utilise a hybrid approach combining scaled mid-Reynolds number DNS results with high Reynolds number experimental data.
