## Current Research

- **Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford University**
  - **Research Group:** Center for Turbulence Research
  - **PI:** [Prof. Beverley J. McKeon](https://me.stanford.edu/people/beverley-mckeon)
  - **Project Focus:** Examining and modelling the impact of large-scale fluctuations on sub-convective pressure and wall shear stress.
  - **Objectives:**
    - Analyse linear and nonlinear contributions to sub-convective pressure fluctuations.
    - Investigate the origin of sub-convective shear stress fluctuations, particularly wall-normal velocity gradients at the wall.
    - Understand the spatial origins and underlying nonlinear interactions that excite these fluctuations.
  - **Methodology:** Utilise a hybrid approach combining scaled mid-Reynolds number DNS results with high Reynolds number experimental data.

## Recent Publications

#### Massey, J., Ganapathisubramani, B., & Weymouth, G. (2023). A systematic investigation into the effect of roughness on self-propelled swimming plates. *Journal of Fluid Mechanics*, 971, A39. [doi:10.1017/jfm.2023.703](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2023.703)
- Examined the impact of egg-carton surface roughness on the hydrodynamics of Self-Propelled Swimming (SPS) bodies.
- Identified that decreasing roughness wavelength necessitates higher undulation speeds to counteract drag, leading to higher energy costs and reduced swimming efficiency.
- Revealed that roughness can significantly enhance flow enstrophy without corresponding force spikes, indicating induced secondary flow structures extending to the boundary layer edge.

#### Massey, J., Symon, S., Ganapathisubramani, B., & Weymouth, G. (2024). Resolvent analysis of a swimming foil. **Under preparation for** *Journal of Fluid Mechanics*
- Investigates and develops the Data-Driven resolvent analysis framework.
- Applied a novel coordinate transform to study the boundary-layer of moving bodies.
- Reveals the dominant unstable modes of undulatory swimming.
