## About me

I am a researcher specializing in fluid dynamics, leveraging a strong background in high-performance computing to employ advanced simulations and data analytics. My work aims to deepen our understanding of complex fluid systems.

I recently completed my PhD at the University of Southampton, focusing on the effect of roughness on the hydrodynamics of aquatic locomotionâ€”essentially exploring whether fish scales improve swimming efficiency.

Currently, I am starting a postdoc at Stanford, where I will be part of a team examining and modeling the impact of large-scale fluctuations on sub-convective pressure and wall shear stress.
