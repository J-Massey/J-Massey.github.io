## Guidlines for students

    I am focused, and need time with my thoughts. To get the most out of me you should give me work to discuss ahead of time, preferably with a write-up of about half a page. Follow the classic: introduction, methods, results, problems/discussion format. This will allow me to think about the problem and direct you effectively.

    It is okay to make mistakes, I do all the time. I'm here to help you get through them. If you got everything right the whole time, you wouldn't need me.

    <!-- Holidays are important, and should be taken. Good times to do this are after deadlines like conferences, paper/thesis drafts & submissions etc. I will be taking holidays too, normally I'm away at Christmas -->

## Interviews

    You should ask questions about the culture: "when was the last time you helped someone through to a promotion", "what's a good example of you adapting your management style to get the most out of a student", "how do you handle conflict in the group", "how do you protect students from burnout". They might not have a good answer, but they reallty should, at least consider these things.
